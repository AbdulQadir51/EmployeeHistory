# EmployeeHistory


It would be beneficial to me as a business owner to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company, so that I can organize and plan my company's activities.


The application will accept user input from a command-line interface. After I launch it. I then see the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. Upon selecting all departments. After that, I am shown a table with the department names and IDs. I choose all roles to view the table. Next, I see the role id, the department to which the role belongs, as well as the salary for the role. If I look at all employees. An overview of employee data is then presented to me, including employee IDs, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers. The department can then be added. Following that, I am asked to add the department name to the database. Next, I am prompted to add a role to the database. After I enter the job title, salary, and department for the role, it is added to the database. When I choose to add an employee. When I am asked to enter the employee's first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database. When updating an employee role. Afterward, I am prompted to choose an employee to update and to select their new role. This information is then updated in the database.
